### How to create a react app?

#### 1. Slow Installation

npx create-react-app <project-name>

- `npx` is node package executor
- `create-react-app` utility/software

#### 2. Faster than the above by using vite (https://vite.dev/)

npm create vite@latest

- Enter Project name - 01vitereact
- Select a framework - React
- Select a variant - JavaScript
- cd 01vitereact
- npm install (as node_modules package doesn't come during setup)
- npm run dev
